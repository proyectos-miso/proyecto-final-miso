# Definition of Done and security gate · HOTFIX

| Field | Value |

| Security status | SECURITY_VERIFIED |

| Command | python sdd/tools/sdd.py spec validate specs/HOTFIX-correcciones-de-hu-web-12 |

<!-- Status: IN_PROGRESS, IMPLEMENTED, SECURITY_TESTS_PENDING, SECURITY_REVIEW_PENDING, RISK_ACCEPTED,
     SECURITY_VERIFIED or BLOCKED. The validator computes the status the evidence supports and rejects a
     higher declared one. An agent may prepare evidence; it never signs reviews or accepts risk.
     With "requireSignatures": false in sdd/config.json, the merge request approval is the security review
     and risk decisions recorded in the spec count as accepted; the two signature tables are optional. -->
